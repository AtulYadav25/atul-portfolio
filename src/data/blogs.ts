# Building Scalable Web Applications

When building web applications, scalability should be a primary concern from day one. Here's what I've learned from building production apps.

## Start with the Right Architecture

Choose your tech stack carefully:
- **Frontend**: React or Next.js for modern UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
- **Hosting**: Vercel, AWS, or similar cloud platforms

## Database Design Matters

Proper database design can make or break your app's performance:
- Normalize your data structure
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields
- Use database migrations for version control
- Implement connection pooling

## Implement Caching Early

Don't wait until you have performance issues:
\`\`\`javascript
// Example Redis caching
const cachedData = await redis.get(key);
if (cachedData) return JSON.parse(cachedData);

const data = await fetchFromDatabase();
await redis.setex(key, 3600, JSON.stringify(data));
return data;
\`\`\`

## Monitor Everything

Set up monitoring from the start:
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
- Uptime monitoring
- User analytics

Remember: premature optimization is the root of all evil, but ignoring scalability from the start is worse.
